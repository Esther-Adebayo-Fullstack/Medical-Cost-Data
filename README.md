# Medical-Cost-Data

Patient Treatment Cost Analysis
Overview
This project explores a dataset dedicated to the cost of treatment for different patients. The treatment cost varies based on several factors such as the type of clinic, city of residence, and age, among others. While we lack data on patients' diagnoses, we can utilize other available information to draw conclusions about patients' health and perform regression analysis.

Goals
Understand the dataset: Get familiar with the structure and features of the dataset.
Data Cleaning and Preparation: Handle missing values, correct data types, and preprocess data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to uncover patterns and insights from the data.
Regression Analysis: Build and evaluate regression models to predict the cost of treatment based on available features.
Dataset
The dataset contains information on patients and their treatment costs. Key features include:

Type of Clinic: The clinic where the patient received treatment.
City of Residence: The city where the patient lives.
Age: The age of the patient.
Treatment Cost: The cost incurred for the patient's treatment.
Project Structure

notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, analysis, and modeling.
src/: Source code for data processing and model building.
reports/: Generated analysis reports and visualizations.
README.md: Project overview and instructions.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7 or higher
Jupyter Notebook
Required Python libraries (listed in requirements.txt)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/patient-treatment-cost-analysis.git
cd patient-treatment-cost-analysis
Create a virtual environment and activate it:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Analysis
Navigate to the notebooks/ directory:

bash
Copy code
cd notebooks
Launch Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open and run the notebooks to perform data exploration, analysis, and regression modeling.

Analysis Workflow
Data Understanding:

Load the dataset.
Understand the structure and key features.
Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values.
Convert data types if necessary.
Preprocess data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Generate descriptive statistics.
Visualize distributions and relationships between features.
Identify patterns and outliers.
Regression Analysis:

Prepare data for modeling.
Build regression models to predict treatment costs.
Evaluate model performance.
Results and Findings
Results and key insights from the analysis will be documented in the reports/ directory. This will include:

Summary statistics and visualizations.
Key findings from exploratory data analysis.
Regression model performance and interpretation.
Conclusion
Through this project, we aim to gain insights into the factors influencing treatment costs and develop predictive models to estimate these costs. Despite the absence of diagnosis data, the analysis can still provide valuable conclusions about patient health and treatment expenses.
